### Chatbot-Project

This is part of my second semester college project in the subject "Internettechnologies". The goal is to create a simple Chatbot, using a word-spotter.
The topic of the bot is being a travel-agent through some countries in europe. I decided on this topic, since I thought it would make this small project more exciting and give me personally a bit of a challenge.

## Tools used

For the frontend I decided to use Angular, since it gives me the opportunity to use quite nice looking Overlays without much effort. Furthermore it is easy to implement the given Chat-template.

For the backend I decided to use the word-spotter given by our professor. It was made with NodeJS.

## Setup

You will need Angular and NodeJS to run this project.

- If you are on linux, you can run the "start.sh" file and everything should work.
- On Windows you need to go into the separate folders and execute following commands:
- 	In the folder "Chatbotpage" you will run "ng serve"
- 	In the folder "Chatbackend" you will run "node staticExpress.js"
